    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Oatmeal is a great, healthy dish, full of carbohydrates that provides you
        with a large dose of energy. That is why it is widely used as a breakfast
        meal. This recipe makes it even tastier, thanks to the additional
        ingredients that we will use. If you like both bananas & oatmeal, then you
        should definitely try the recipe yourself. Enjoy!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup of oat flakes</li>
        <li>¾ cup of milk</li>
        <li>1 whole banana</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of chia seeds</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of date flakes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of liquid honey</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Add the oat flakes and milk into a pot and heat it over a medium heat,
            stirring it slowly all the time. Stir it until you notice that the oat
            flakes absorbed enough milk, and the milk became more creamy than
            liquid.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the meantime, cut the banana into slices and then mash them in a bowl
            that you'll serve the Oatmeal in.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once you see that the oat flakes & milk are ready, transfer them from
            the pot to the bowl with mashed bananas. Add chia seeds, date flakes and
            liquid honey.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix it well and let it rest for 1 to 2 minutes before eating.
        </li>
    </ol>
