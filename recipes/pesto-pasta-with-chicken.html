    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This chicken pesto pasta is easy and delicious. Serve with crusty bread
        and salad for a quick dinner. Use as much or as little pesto sauce as you
        like. Using homemade pesto will taste even better, but it adds to prep
        time. Enjoy!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package bow tie pasta</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>1 pinch crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup pesto sauce</li>
        <li>⅓ cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, drained and cut into strips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook
            until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Sauté garlic until tender,
            then stir in chicken and season with red pepper flakes. Cook until
            chicken is golden and cooked through.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine pasta, chicken, pesto, and sun-dried tomatoes in a large bowl;
            toss to coat evenly.
