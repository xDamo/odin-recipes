    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This pesto pasta with chicken is a great, tasty idea for a dish that can
        be served for lunch. Be careful though, as the whole meal itself tend to
        be high in calories. It is due to the fact that it's rich in fats, but
        these are mostly healthy fats. Therefore, I recommend choosing the portion
        size wisely. The below recipe and ingredients used in it is a perfect
        serving for two people. Enjoy!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>300 grams of bow tie pasta</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, minced</li>
        <li>
            1 bigger skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into bite-sized pieces
            (around 300g)
        </li>
        <li>1 pinch of each: salt, pepper, red pepper powder, garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 whole cup of pesto sauce (around 190g)</li>
        <li>⅓ cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes with herbs, cut into strips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and place it into a bowl. Add 1
            teaspoon of olive oil, all the spices (salt, pepper, red pepper powder,
            garlic powder) and mix it well.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fill a large pot with water, add a pinch of salt to it a bring it to
            boil. Add pasta to the boiling water and after a while reduce the heat
            by a little. Follow the instructions that shall be provided on the
            packing of pasta, for it to be prepared al-dente. In most cases this is
            8-10 minutes. Drain the pasta after.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the meantime, heat a little bit of olive oil in a deep pan over
            medium heat. Sauté garlic until tender, then stir in the chicken mix
            that we prepared before. Cook until chicken is golden and cooked
            through.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add pesto into the pan and mix for a while. Then add the sun-dried
            tomatoes and mix it for short period of time as well. Finally, follow
            through by adding the pasta and heat it over low to medium heat for 1 to
            2 minutes, mixing it at the same time. Make sure that pesto covers your
            pasta evenly!

            <p>OPTIONAL</p>
            <p>
                While performing the previous step, you could also try adding some
                pasta water into the pan. It is used to make the pesto creamier!
