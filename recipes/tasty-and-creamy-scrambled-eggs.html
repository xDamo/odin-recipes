    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 whole eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of butter (around 10g)</li>
        <li>1 pinch of salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Crack the eggs into a container of your choice (a bowl or a bigger glass
            will do). Add pinch of salt and pepper and mix it well until it becomes
            a solid yellow/orange-ish texture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat the pan over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of butter onto it in the
            meantime. Make sure to cover the whole pan with the butter while it
            melts. Once you get the butter melted, add egg mix into the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            When you see that the egg mixture is starting to set slowly, begin
            stirring it slowly, all the time from now on. Now, instead of changing
            the heat, remove the pan from the heat and put it back again every once
            in a while, and remember to stir the eggs mixture at the same time. This
            will help us achieving the additional creaminess.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook and stir it using this method until set but still moist. It should
            take around 3 to 5 minutes. This way you can adjust the texture &
            creaminess to your own liking. Remember to not overdry the eggs, because
            it makes the creaminess disappear.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve with bread of your choice!
        </li>
    </ol>
